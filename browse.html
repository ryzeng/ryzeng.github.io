          <span style="color: #1abc9c;">Browse</span> is a fictional browser extension that simplifies the online shopping experience for the elderly and technically challenged.
        </h1>
        <p class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 text">
          Browse was originally conceived through the Berkeley Innovation Spring 2017 Design Challenge.

          The prompt: 
        </p>
        <p class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 text">
          <span style="font-family:Permanent Marker, cursive; font-size: 32px">Consider the package and mail delivery experience. Define a user problem and propose a design solution.</span>
        </p>
      <div class="row">
        <p class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 text">
          I thought up this idea for the design challenge with my grandparents in mind. My grandparents, both over the age of 80, recently moved into a new apartment complex and experienced some difficulty obtaining groceries and other miscellaneous household items. 
        </p>
        <p class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 text">
          I began the user research process with some assumptions and contraints to narrow down the target market. The ideal user would be at least 55 years old, have little to no experience with technology, and has a time constraint of 30 minutes on the computer. 
        </p>
        <p class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 text">
          I realized that many online shopping websites were filled with too much noise and clutter. Older users and those who are less tech-savvy get distracted by the myriad of call-to-actions. Even if the user successfully ordered the package, he or she might struggle with the contents of the package if it's too large or heavy. 
        </p>
        <p class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 text">
          I drafted up a quick and dirty discussion guide, called my grandparents, and proceeded to interview them as perfect users for my target market. 
        </p>
        <p class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 text">
          With time constraints, I went straight from lo-fi prototypes to hi-fi prototypes, displaying how the potential browser extension would work on the most popular online shopping website, Amazon. 
        </p>
        <p class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 text">
          As a bonus round, I also ideated on the physical package delivery system. Since the target market accounted for the elderly, packages should not only be delivered to the door; they should be brought inside the home. Assistance with packages should be provided to those who require it. 
        </p>
